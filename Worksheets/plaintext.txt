Are You Really Free? ? ?
===========================
You think that you are free.

But there is not a thought
an emotion, an attitude
and belief in you
that is not coming
from some others.

And you do not know it.

Are you really free? ?

You feel pretty strong
about certain things.
But are you really?

You are a result of
Your conditioning
and programming.

You are not free.

Dr. Antony Theodore
